<body>
<div id="first">
  <p>Sometimes, I don’t know how to put things into words, but I just want you to know that your presence means more than you might realize. You bring a strange calmness, like a pause in chaos — and it’s comforting. Whether we talk a lot or just share silence, there’s something about your vibe that feels real, unfiltered, and rare.

  </p>
</div>
<div id="second">
<p>
  I often find myself thinking about the little moments — the way you smile, your random thoughts, or how you express yourself. They stick with me. You’re not just someone passing through life; you leave an impact, and I hope you always know your value, even when the world gets heavy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="third">
<p>
  No matter where life takes you, I hope you hold onto your softness, your light, and your ability to make others feel seen. People like you are rare — not loud, not flashy — but deeply unforgettable. So just a reminder: you're appreciated, you're noticed, and you matter more than you probably hear.
